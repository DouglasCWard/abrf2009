<p><span style="font-size: larger"><strong>MARC (Minority Access to Research Careers) Travel Awards</strong></span><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><font color="#000000">The FASEB Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC) Program, in partnership with the ABRF, is offering minority trainee travel awards for participation in the ABRF 2009 conference.&nbsp; These awards are provided to help promote the entry of under represented minority scientists*, full-time students, post-baccalaureates and postdoctoral fellows into the mainstream of the basic science community, and to encourage the participation of young investigators and technicians in the ABRF&nbsp;annual meeting.</font></p>
<p>The FASEB MARC Travel Awards are for U.S.A. citizens or Permanent Residents of the U.S.A. (green card holders) only*.&nbsp; Successful applicants will be reimbursed up to approximately $1,850 in meeting registration and travel-related expenses.&nbsp; The travel award recipients will be selected based on&nbsp;submitted scientific abstracts and eligibility to receive MARC funds.&nbsp; Abstracts will be selected for presentation in poster sessions.</p>
<p>For more information and for application forms, please go to: <a href="http://marc.faseb.org/pages/page2a.htm">http://marc.faseb.org/pages/page2a.htm</a></p>
<p>* Qualified ethnic minority groups that are identified as being underrepresented in the biomedical and behavioral sciences include: African Americans, Alaskan Natives, Hispanic Americans, American Indians/Native Americans and Natives of the U.S. Pacific Islands (Guam or Hawai'i). &nbsp;Individuals on temporary or student visas are not eligible for FASEB MARC Program funding.</p>
<p>There are two types of MARC travel awards:</p>

The faculty/mentor must nominate up to two students and/or post-baccalaureates who are pursuing research careers in a life sciences discipline.&nbsp; The faculty member does not need to be a minority.</li>
