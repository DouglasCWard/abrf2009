                  This application for an exhibit space, the formal notice of space assignment by Exhibit Management and full payment of rental charges for exhibit space, together constitute a contract for the right to exhibit at the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities Symposium. Exhibit Management refers to ABRF,&nbsp;Courtesy Associates Exhibit Management, Memphis Cook Convention Center, Freeman and designated agents of ABRF.&nbsp; <a href="#top">Top</a></p>

                  </span></span><br />
                  Exhibits must be of an educational character and relevant to the registrants&rsquo; scientific and professional interests.&nbsp; ABRF reserves the right,&nbsp;at its sole discretion, to accept or deny applications for exhibit space and to allocate space among exhibitors.&nbsp; By applying for exhibit space, an exhibitor agrees to adhere to all conditions and regulations outlined below.&nbsp; Conformity with these Rules and Regulations for this Symposium will be monitored by Exhibit Management.&nbsp; <a href="#top">Top</a></p>

                  <br />
                  Space assignment will be made on a first-received (time stamped) first-assigned basis, with priority given to Platinum Corporate Sponsors, second priority to Gold Corporate Sponsors.&nbsp; Whenever possible, space will be allotted according to the exhibitor's choice, but the final arrangements will be determined by Exhibit Management in a way that produces the most advantageous grouping of the exhibits.&nbsp; ABRF shall have no liability if the space location assigned is not as requested.&nbsp; A 50-word description of products and/or services to be displayed in your booth must be submitted.&nbsp; This information will be published in the Meeting Program provided that the application and description is received no later than October 30, 2008.&nbsp; If the description is not provided by the deadline date only the name, address and booth number will be printed in the Meeting Program.&nbsp; The description must be submitted on-line.&nbsp; Instructions to key in this information will be included in the exhibit space confirmation packet.</p>
                  <p>Booths or display structures must be self-supporting, and not anchored to walls or floors.&nbsp; All displays or exhibits must be fireproofed to conform with Local, State and Federal codes, laws or ordinances.&nbsp; All displays or exhibits must comply with specific dimensions and restrictions spelled out by the code of ethics and exhibit rules endorsed by the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities.&nbsp; Equipment displays and booth structures must not extend into the aisle in such a way as to obstruct traffic or visibility of adjacent booths.&nbsp; Display material exposing an unfinished surface to neighboring booths is not permitted and must be finished at the exhibitor&rsquo;s expense.</p>
                  <p>Exhibit Management reserves the right in its sole discretion to restrict exhibits which are objectionable because of noise, method of operation, materials, or conduct, and also to prohibit or to evict for any reason with or without giving cause, any exhibit which in the opinion of Exhibit Management may detract from the general character of the exhibit as a whole.&nbsp; This restriction includes persons, things, conduct, printed matter, or anything of a character which Exhibit Management determines objectionable.&nbsp; In the event of such restriction or eviction, Exhibit Management is not liable for any refunds or other exhibit expenses under any circumstances.</p>
                  <p>Exhibit Management has secured all exhibit function, meeting, hospitality suites and space.&nbsp; Assignments of the above will be by Exhibit Management only upon completion of the appropriate application form.&nbsp; The use of hospitality suites and function space will be governed by the policies set forth by Exhibit Management.&nbsp; Exhibitors who attempt to bypass Exhibit Management by negotiating directly for these areas with the facility personnel will not be permitted to exhibit at the ABRF.&nbsp; Exhibitors who do not comply will jeopardize their ability to exhibit at future conferences.&nbsp; <a href="#top">Top</a></p>
