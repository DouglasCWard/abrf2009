                      <li>If you choose to enter the abstract text in the field provided, please type the content directly into the text field, or&nbsp;copy and paste your abstract text into the text field.&nbsp; If you copy and paste, please paste from a simple text (.txt) file.&nbsp; Copying and pasting directly from a word processing document may result in problems with text characters and formatting.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><u>Please note:</u></p>
                  <ul>
                      <li><strong>Abstract text&nbsp;is limited to 300 words.</strong>&nbsp; If your abstract exceeds this limit, a message will appear indicating that your abstract has gone over the maximum word limit.&nbsp; Please correct this error before you hit &quot;Submit&quot;.<br />

                      <li>Do <strong>not </strong>include the title and author(s)&nbsp;in the abstract text box on the online form or in your word file.&nbsp; They must be entered separately in the title and author fields of the abstract submission form.<br />
                      &nbsp;</li>

                      &nbsp;</li>
                      <li>If you need to make corrections to your abstract submission, after completing the online submission process, please contact Chezka Solon at <a href="mailto:abrf@courtesyassoc.com">abrf@courtesyassoc.com</a>.&nbsp; Please note that requested changes should be submitted before the submission deadline.&nbsp; It may not be possible to implement changes that are requested after the submission deadline. <br />

                      <li>Once you have uploaded your abstract file or entered the text into the abstract text field, please be sure to review your submission.</li>

                  </u><span style="font-size: smaller"><u>Common errors to look for</u>:</span></h3>
                  <p>In reviewing your work, check for the following typical errors:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Duplicate title and/or author(s).&nbsp; If this occurs, it is most likely caused by the title and/or author block being entered into the abstract text box.&nbsp; These must be entered separately in the title and author text fields.&nbsp; Remember to delete any titles and/or authors from the text box, or uploaded abstract file.&nbsp;</li>
                      <li>The title is in all caps.&nbsp; Only the first letter of each word should be capitalized.&nbsp; Do not use <strong>bold</strong> text or ALL UPPERCASE characters.&nbsp;</li>
                      <li>The same affiliation is listed more than once in the author block.&nbsp; This is due to the same institution being entered differently.&nbsp; Double check that common affiliations are typed in exactly the same manner each time.&nbsp;</li>
                      <li>If there is more than one organization represented, be sure to number the authors and their associated affiliation appropriately.</li>
                  </ul>
