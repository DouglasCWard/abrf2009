<p>Academic institutions and research institutes can also sponsor the ABRF 2009 meeting through the <a href="/index.cfm/page/sponsorships/opportunites.htm">Satellite Educational Workshop Sponsorship </a>and <a href="/index.cfm/page/sponsorships/opportunites.htm">Meeting Sponsorship </a>opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please inform senior administration officials in your organization about these ABRF meeting sponsorship opportunities and let them know how much your cores benefit from the ABRF and its annual conference.&nbsp; An ABRF meeting sponsorship can increase the visibility of your academic institution or non-profit research institute in the life sciences core facility community.&nbsp; Moreover, bringing these sponsorship opportunities to the attention of senior administrators in an academic institution helps spread the word about the important core facility activities of the ABRF and can have a positive impact on the standing of core facilities within an academic organization.</p>
<p>We appreciate your support of the ABRF 2009 conference.<br />
