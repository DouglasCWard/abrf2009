<a href="/index.cfm/page/sponsorships/opportunites.htm"><strong>ABRF 2009 Main Meeting&nbsp;Sponsorship</strong></a><strong> </strong>opportunities are available to exhibiting companies that want to increase their corporate or brand visibility to the ABRF meeting attendees.&nbsp; All sponsors are acknowledged in the official meeting program, on the ABRF meeting website, on signage throughout the convention center, on booth &quot;thank you&quot; certificates, and on staff ribbons. These sponsorships are offered on an enduring basis to exhibitors. &nbsp;Current sponsors have the first right-of-refusal.&nbsp; Companies that are a sponsor of ABRF also receive priority exhibitor booth selection, if they submit their booth application for the following year's meeting at the current year's conference when sales begin for the following year.</p>
